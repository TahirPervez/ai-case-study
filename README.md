# Waymo Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Waymo is an autonomous automobile company, with roots placing the initial development occuring due to the 
2005 DARPA Grand Challenges, founded by Sebastian Thrun and Anthony Levandowski. After several years of work, 
in 2009 it was expanded into the Google Self-Driving Car Project, then incroportated as an independent company in 2016.
Currently, Waymo is funded through rounds of external investment, currently having raised $5.5 billion through mutliple waves.
> Prior to this, Waymo raised $2.3 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. 
The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, 
AutoNation , Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management and 
Research Company and more. ![6](https://coverager.com/alphabet-to-invest-5-billion-in-waymo/)

## Business Activities

A primary goal of Waymo is to ensure safety of the roads. and in doing so, allow a superior transportation system 
as seen by thier offical mission statment:
> Every year, 1.4M lives are lost to traffic crashes around the world. The status quo is not acceptable. 
Waymo is committed to holding safety to a higher standard. Because when we do, we make space for people to get 
around in a whole new way. On this path, we aim to offer freedom of movement for all, create a sustainable, efficient 
transportation ecosystem, and make the planet better than we found it. ![1](https://waymo.com/)

Accordiung to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ![17](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812115)
, approximately 94% of crashes in the US are due to human error. 
> A critical reason can be assigned to a driver, vehicle, or environ-
ment. Normally, one critical reason was assigned per crash, based
upon NMVCCS researcher’s crash assessment. The critical reason
was assigned to the driver in an estimated 94 percent (±2.2%) of
the crashes (Table 1). In addition, the critical reason was assigned
to the vehicle in an estimated 2 percent (±0.7%) and to the environ-
ment in about 2 percent (±1.3%) of the crashes.

By taking the human factor out of the car, Waymo is able to commit to securing safety 
on the roads. This is paired with the goal of having autonoumous cars accessible to the standard 
user through ride share services. According to pymnts ![18](https://www.pymnts.com/innovation/2019/who-will-use-self-driving-cars/),
there is an interest in some form of ride share based utilizing autonomous vehicles, although people are still more skeptical 
and not yet trusting when it comes to putting their and their families safety in their hand, showing that trust still needs to be developed.

Waymo cars navigate their environment using a combination of LiDAR, cameras, microphones, and HD maps. LiDAR is effectivly a laser based sonar, 
and is effective both in light and dark environments, capable of "seeing" far distances, which is valuable when it comes to 
operating at high speeds, like on a highway. There are cameras capable of operating in both standard and low light conditions,
that allow the Waymo to get a 360 degree view of the world around it as a human would see it, allowing for visual identification of
traffic lights and signs, to effectivly follow the rules of the road.  Microphones are used to idenify EMS sirens in order to give way.
Finally, HD maps act mostly for the sake of planning ahead. 
> High Definition (HD) maps are maps with precise definitions of road lanes with rich semantics of the traffic rules. 
They are critical for several key stages in an autonomous driving system, including motion forecasting and planning. 

The main advantage that Waymo has over its competitors would be being a pioneer as well as their priorization of safety. Being a 
pioneer is advantageous to them as it allowed for them to strike deals with cities to allow for Waymo to gather their test data without
having to worry about dealing with a competitor also trying to gather data from the same city. Their priorization of safety helps
in that they can work for lower accident rates, to help ensure trust doesn't break.

## Issues

* What major issues has the company faced?
A major challenge for Waymo is a matter of scale. LiDAR is both expensive, and complex, 
meaning the scaling up is complicated. Cars reliant just on cameras can be made cheaper, and have 
a large fleet to allow for more testing.
Consumer owned not feasible

* What issues in terms of perception has the company faced?
There have been mulitple crashes of Waymos, some fatal that have soured public perception. This is made 
slightly more difficult as the cars are restricted in where they are allowed to operate as they need to have 
an agreement with the city beforehand.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Waymo is in the self-driving automobile industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
The major trend in autonomous automobiles would simply be their existence. They are still in the process of becoming commonplace, and having their algorithms developed. The only real major advancement would be the increase in terms of autonomy, going from something that slightly assists a human driver to something that can be self-piloted depending on the road conditions.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Other major companies include Zoox, Cruise, Rivian, Aurora, and Tesla. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The primary impacts of Waymo would be the advancements made towards self driving cars, going from at best cruise control to the point of a functioning self driving car. Throughoout their growth, they have intoiduced the need for legistlation with regards to accidents involving autonoumous vehicles.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
A core metric used is safety compared to human drivers. Waymo reported
    > An 85% reduction or 6.8 times lower crash rate involving any injury, from minor to severe and fatal cases (0.41 incidence per million miles for the Waymo Driver vs 2.78 for the human benchmark)
	> A 57% reduction or 2.3 times lower police-reported crash rate (2.1 incidence per million miles for the Waymo Driver vs. 4.85 for the human benchmark)(12)
![Waymo % Change for Police / Injury-Reported Rate](https://images.ctfassets.net/e6t5diu0txbw/4gzabJgoo5jGxaCWZpKo0e/13de274b9ca40a8149d79dc8ee99fcef/pasted_image_0.png?fm=webp)


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Waymo is doing better than its competitors. 
Uber and Apple both had attempted to enter the field of self-driving cars, but ended their programs. 
Cruise, on the other hand, has paused their autonomous taxis due to an accident that had occured.
Tesla has a lower level of autonomous car compared to Waymo.
All together, it seems that Waymo's focus on safety is helping it stay ahead as it can minimize backlash from broken trust.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
If I was to advise Waymo, I would suggest looking into seeing about coming to an arangement with cities to be creating and providing autonomous buses.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Major benefits for this would be simply the fact that it would help with spreading trust in Waymo as they are introduced to new cities, as well as allowing them to be able to expand the amount of autonoumous miles that they can log. In addition, having known routes that aren't changing can be very feasable to the current state of the technology.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The only major technologies needed to be added into this would be some way to identify if people are wanting to get on at the next stop, as busses stopping at every stop would make them more frustrating.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These are appropritate since busses ideally only stop at a bus stop if someone wants to get on or off at the stop.
