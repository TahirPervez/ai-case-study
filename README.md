# Waymo Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Waymo is an autonomous automobile company, with roots placing the initial development occuring due to the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenges, founded by Sebastian Thrun and Anthony Levandowski.
After several years of work, in 2009 it was expanded into the Google Self-Driving Car Project, then incroportated as an independent company in 2016.
Currently, Waymo is funded through rounds of external investment, currently having raised $5.5 billion through mutliple waves.
> Prior to this, Waymo raised $2.3 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation , Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management and Research Company and more.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Waymo seeks to make the roads safer for everyone. The number one cause of car accidents is due to user error, at a whopping 94%. By removing the human factor from the equaltion, car accidents could drop from ~2.2 million to ~150 thousand per year in the US (8). We see this goal though their mission statement:
> Every year, 1.4M lives are lost to traffic crashes around the world. The status quo is not acceptable. Waymo is committed to holding safety to a higher standard. Because when we do, we make space for people to get around in a whole new way. On this path, we aim to offer freedom of movement for all, create a sustainable, efficient transportation ecosystem, and make the planet better than we found it. (1)

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customers would directly be the automobile industry, and indirectly you average person. > Most (53 percent) of consumers could see fully automated vehicles on the market within two to 10 years, and more than half of Americans (55 percent) think most cars will have the ability to drive themselves by 2029. (9)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The major advantage that they have over their competitors is being the pioneer. Throughout its growth, Waymo has focused on a slow grow where safety is paramount, as trust is very easy to break.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Waymo uses LIDAR and HD maps to navigate through terraine. This differs from some competitors in the reliance on the maps, as well as the usage of LIDAR rather than just cameras.

A primary goal of Waymo is to ensure safety of the roads by removing the number one cause of car accidents: human error.
Accordiung to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (17), approximately 94% of crashes in the US are due to human error. 
> A critical reason can be assigned to a driver, vehicle, or environ-
ment. Normally, one critical reason was assigned per crash, based
upon NMVCCS researcher’s crash assessment. The critical reason
was assigned to the driver in an estimated 94 percent (±2.2%) of
the crashes (Table 1). In addition, the critical reason was assigned
to the vehicle in an estimated 2 percent (±0.7%) and to the environ-
ment in about 2 percent (±1.3%) of the crashes.
## Issues

* What major issues has the company faced?
A major challenge for Waymo is a matter of scale. LIDAR is both expensive, and complex, meaning the scaling up is complicated. Cars reliant just on cameras can be made cheaper, and have a large fleet to allow for more testing.

* What issues in terms of perception has the company faced?
There have been mulitple crashes of Waymos, some fatal that have soured public perception. This is made slightly more difficult as the cars are restricted in where they are allowed to operate as they need to have an agreement with the city beforehand.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Waymo is in the self-driving automobile industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
The major trend in autonomous automobiles would simply be their existence. They are still in the process of becoming commonplace, and having their algorithms developed. The only real major advancement would be the increase in terms of autonomy, going from something that slightly assists a human driver to something that can be self-piloted depending on the road conditions.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Other major companies include Zoox, Cruise, Rivian, Aurora, and Tesla. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The primary impacts of Waymo would be the advancements made towards self driving cars, going from at best cruise control to the point of a functioning self driving car. Throughoout their growth, they have intoiduced the need for legistlation with regards to accidents involving autonoumous vehicles.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
A core metric used is safety compared to human drivers. Waymo reported
    > An 85% reduction or 6.8 times lower crash rate involving any injury, from minor to severe and fatal cases (0.41 incidence per million miles for the Waymo Driver vs 2.78 for the human benchmark)
	> A 57% reduction or 2.3 times lower police-reported crash rate (2.1 incidence per million miles for the Waymo Driver vs. 4.85 for the human benchmark)(12)

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Waymo is doing better than its competitors. 
Uber and Apple both had attempted to enter the field of self-driving cars, but ended their programs. 
Cruise, on the other hand, has paused their autonomous taxis due to an accident that had occured.
Tesla has a lower level of autonomous car compared to Waymo.
All together, it seems that Waymo's focus on safety is helping it stay ahead as it can minimize backlash from broken trust.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
If I was to advise Waymo, I would suggest looking into seeing about coming to an arangement with cities to be creating and providing autonomous buses.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Major benefits for this would be simply the fact that it would help with spreading trust in Waymo as they are introduced to new cities, as well as allowing them to be able to expand the amount of autonoumous miles that they can log. In addition, having known routes that aren't changing can be very feasable to the current state of the technology.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The only major technologies needed to be added into this would be some way to identify if people are wanting to get on at the next stop, as busses stopping at every stop would make them more frustrating.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These are appropritate since busses ideally only stop at a bus stop if someone wants to get on or off at the stop.
